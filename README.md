# SawyerNotes

## Intent
This application's intent is to disable the keyboard and mouse, yet leave the screen on for entertainment purposes.

## Namesake
Named after my 1-year-old son who likes to "take notes" while my wife lets him watch videos on her computer.

On MacOSX, you can turn it off via the top bar, or just `command + q`
